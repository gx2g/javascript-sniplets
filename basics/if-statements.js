/* 

The code block in the if statement will run because myVariable has a 
truthy value; even though the value of myVariable is not explicitly 
the value true, when used in a boolean or conditional context, 
it evaluates to true because it has been assigned a non-falsy value.

So which values are falsyâ€” or evaluate to false when checked as a condition? The list of falsy values includes:

0
Empty strings like "" or ''
null which represent when there is no value at all
undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
NaN, or Not a Number
