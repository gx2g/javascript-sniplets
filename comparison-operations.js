/*

Comparisons are used to define 
conditions, perform checks, 
and make decisions in JavaScript. 
These operations return a boolean 
value (true or false), which other 
operators use to determine certain actions.

Equal and Not Equal
The Equal To operation (==) returns true 
if the first value equals the second value 
and false otherwise.

Conversely, the Not Equal To operation (!=) 
returns true if the values are unequal.
