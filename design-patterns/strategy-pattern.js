referrs to encapsulating a group of data or functions

what is Encapsulation in OOP?

Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some 
components of an object, so users cannot access state values for 
all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be
used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated
with an instantiated class or object.


- In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation 
  (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods 
  that operate on that data, into a single unit.

- Containers are just one example of encapsulation in coding where data and methods 
  are bundled together into a single package.

- A key benefits to hiding information about attributes and methods using encapsulation 
  in programming is that it prevents other developers from writing scripts or APIs that 
  use your code.

Benefits of encapsulation programming

Encapsulation in programming has a few key benefits. These include:

Hiding data: 
Users will have no idea how classes are being implemented or stored. 
All that users will know is that values are being passed and initialized.

More flexibility: 
Enables you to set variables as read or write-only. 
Examples include: setName(), setAge() or to set variables as write-only 
then you only need to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge() etc.

Easy to reuse: 
With encapsulation, it's easy to change and adapt to new requirements
